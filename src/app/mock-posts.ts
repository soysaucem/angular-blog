    content: `Model–View–Controller (usually known as MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly used for developing
    user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal
    representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.[1][2]
    The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development.
    Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this architecture has become popular for designing web applications.
    [3] Popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and C# have MVC frameworks that are used in
    web application development straight out of the box.`
